    November, 2018
    Glen Braun

## Introduction
What this document is. Who wrote it. What its purpose is.

This document is a business plan, supporting arguments are provided in footnotes.
	
## Specific Proposals

* Change the corporate structure from consumer co-op to contributor owned, zero margin organization.

* Change the economic structure of RChain from the trade of tokens to fee sharing.

* Change the copyright license of RChain source code from Apache license to Compensated Open Source license.
		
## Scope and Assumptions of this document
The scope is very broad. It is meant to discuss economic principals. It assumes that the abstract representation of value is not forever bound to countable tokens. That it is highly likely that a new field of economic theory, perhaps rightly called "computational economics" will emerge due to the invention of ubiquitous compute infrastructure like RChain.

It assumes that the value of RChain is its computational model expressed by its language Rholang. This implies that the blockchain portion of RChain is of secondary value.

It assumes that the computing industry has been corrupted by highly centralized and too powerful organizations which are stunting the growth of computer technology for the benefit of the planet and the humans who live on it. It presupposes that free open source software will never be economically viable and will never provide the resources needed to overcome the negative outcomes of selfish, profit-only seeking behavior of private enterprise. It argues for a rethinking of intellectual property law and presents the foundation of a new model based on a labor theory of property and implemented in computable smart contracts.

While the scope is very broad, the document's primary focus is a clear argument for an actionable course of immediate action for the RChain community. There are extensive footnotes which provide supporting arguments for the choices of specific actions.
	
## Background
### About the author
Programmer, not economist, not business person, not token trader, not philosopher, not academic, not a lawyer, etc.

I will omit prefixing every statement and opinion with "I'm just a programmer but, … (some opinion in a field I know I'm not qualified to have an opinion)". I justify sharing my opinions because: economic collapse of 2008, books like 'Debunking Economics', etc.
		
### About the document
It is a business plan proposal, supporting arguments are provided in footnotes.

#### How to contribute
Kinds of contributions sought. I'm trying to build a coalition of members of the RChain community. If you'd be so kind, please state your position as 'supporting' or 'against' along with some justification. Questions of clarification are fine. Statements like 'this is the xyz argument' or pointers to other authors who've made similar arguments or who are running similar campaigns in other communities are close to useless. My goal is to convince the RChain community to support this approach and truly work to effect the proposed changes. It's not an academic exercise.
