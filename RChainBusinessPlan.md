# RChain Business Plan
    November, 2018
    Glen Braun

## Introduction
What this document is. Who wrote it. What its purpose is.

This document is a business plan, supporting arguments are provided in footnotes.
	
## Specific Proposals

* Change the corporate structure from consumer co-op to contributor owned, zero margin organization.

* Change the economic structure of RChain from the trade of tokens to fee sharing.

* Change the copyright license of RChain source code from Apache license to Compensated Open Source license.
		
## Scope and Assumptions of this document
The scope is very broad. It is meant to discuss economic principals. It assumes that the abstract representation of value is not forever bound to countable tokens. That it is highly likely that a new field of economic theory, perhaps rightly called "computational economics" will emerge due to the invention of ubiquitous compute infrastructure like RChain.

It assumes that the value of RChain is its computational model expressed by its language Rholang. This implies that the blockchain portion of RChain is of secondary value.

It assumes that the computing industry has been corrupted by highly centralized and too powerful organizations which are stunting the growth of computer technology for the benefit of the planet and the humans who live on it. It presupposes that free open source software will never be economically viable and will never provide the resources needed to overcome the negative outcomes of selfish, profit-only seeking behavior of private enterprise. It argues for a rethinking of intellectual property law and presents the foundation of a new model based on a labor theory of property and implemented in computable smart contracts.

While the scope is very broad, the document's primary focus is a clear argument for an actionable course of immediate action for the RChain community. There are extensive footnotes which provide supporting arguments for the choices of specific actions.
	
## Background
### About the author
Programmer, not economist, not business person, not token trader, not philosopher, not academic, not a lawyer, etc.

I will omit prefixing every statement and opinion with "I'm just a programmer but, … (some opinion in a field I know I'm not qualified to have an opinion)". I justify sharing my opinions because: economic collapse of 2008, books like 'Debunking Economics', etc.
		
### About the document
It is a business plan proposal, supporting arguments are provided in footnotes.

#### How to contribute
Kinds of contributions sought. I'm trying to build a coalition of members of the RChain community. If you'd be so kind, please state your position as 'supporting' or 'against' along with some justification. Questions of clarification are fine. Statements like 'this is the xyz argument' or pointers to other authors who've made similar arguments or who are running similar campaigns in other communities are close to useless. My goal is to convince the RChain community to support this approach and truly work to effect the proposed changes. It's not an academic exercise.

### What is the co-op? What does it own? What power does it have?

### Free Open Source Software vs. Compensated Open Source

### Intellectual property

## Corporate Structure
	The corporate structure is based on the US concept of a Limited Liability Corporation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company). It's understood that RChain is a global initiative. Other structures will be needed to comply or take advantage of the legal corporate structures available in other jurisdictions.
	Contributors are owners; the LLC term is member.
	All members have a compensation contract. Compensation contracts are open until they are closed. 
	The membership is made up of any entity who holds an open compensation contract.
	Compensation contracts close when they have been fully compensated. Membership is terminated when an entity no longer holds an open compensation contract.
	There's an entity called 'the world' which serves as a universal stakeholder and is the default recipient (owner) of closed compensation contracts. Any entity in 'the world' can freely use the intellectual property represented by closed compensation contracts.
	Ownership of copyright is maintained by the person who originated the work. This is distinct from membership in an organization with which a person may be a member through an open compensation agreement. Either the person alone, or an organization, may work to defend its copyright rights.
	Membership entitles the member to participate in governance.
	Only members may participate in governance.
	Governance need not be limited to one-person, one-vote.
	It is a goal of the organization to express membership rights in Rholang but it is recognized that current legal institutions (i.e. courts) are not familiar with Rholang or smart contracts so natural language equivalents will be required.
	
## Copyright license
	License is only granted to entities which agree to compensate contributors.
	Use of the copyrighted material is not free of change while there are open compensation claims against the material.
	Once material has been compensated, the copyright license becomes like other open source licenses like the Apache license.
	Ownership of copyright is maintained on a per-person basis.
	
## Types of contributors
Membership is the RChain LLC is defined by contributions. There is a formal process to become a member; simply making a contribution, of any kind, does not constitute membership whether their contribution(s) were accepted or not. It is the responsibility of the contributor to establish formal membership status. Members of the RChain LLC will likely have made contributions which fall within these broad categories:
### Investors
Investors provide capital which is provided in the form of a loan and valued in a major currency such as US dollars (USD). Interest rates are meant to be competitive with existing expectations of venture capital return on investment. Investors are members and may participate in governance just as any other member. A compensation agreement is used to express the terms of the loan. Loans are to be paid from revenue and do not have a fixed payment schedule. Instead, an agreement of how network usage fees will be routed to investors is defined in Rholang. As with any compensation agreement, membership rights terminate when full compensation has been achieved. It is possible, that no compensation will ever be received, or that compensation will never be fully met. There will be a cap on the maximum compensation to guard against perpetual ownership. At any time, the RChain LLC can choose to fully compensate a compensation agreement which terminates membership for the investor.

### Validators
Validators run RChain nodes. They may also provide stake for a proof of stake blockchain implementation of Rholang. Validators charge fees for executing Rholang programs. Validators agree to the terms of use of the RChain node software and, in particular, agree to its licensing terms. Validators make available Rholang libraries which application developers can use. These libraries are licensed under the compensated open source license. Validators agree to share fees under the compensated open source licensing terms.
Validation is also a contribution so validators are members of the RChain LLC.

### Developers
Developers are people whose contributions are provided in computer source code. Their contributions must be licensed under the compensated open source license. Developers retain their copyright rights but must agree to limit their rights based on the terms of compensation with the RChain LLC.

### Administrators
Administrators are people who provide contributions other than through investment, validation, or development. This includes activities like leadership, legal services, accounting and tax services, marketing, etc. Any intellectual property created by administrators must also agree to the terms of the compensated open source license.

### Contract contributions
Some contributions will be done on contract. It is not preferred that there be perpetual contracts but instead these contributions are meant to be once and done contributions where execution of the formal membership process is not practical. It is permissible that a short (three month) trial period of contribution be defined through contract contributions but only in cases where the normal membership is undesirable to the contributor or not practical for RChain LLC. In general, it is a goal that all contributions be represented through membership. It is permissible that governance rights be extended to contract contributors though not required.
