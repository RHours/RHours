# Education Using RHours Model

## Problem statement: For profit education has disadvantages

## Solution: The RHours Model for Education

### Contributions 
* Researching course material, putting it into learning modules, making quizzes, etc. 
* Teaching classes
* Private tutoring
		
### Revenue model
* Students agree to pay from their future earnings by smart contract
* Students pay a percentage of the increase in their earnings
* All students stop paying once the contributions are compensated
		
### Incentives
* Incentives work to help each other learn because that person you help might earn a bunch of money and help pay for the contributions.
* Incentives to reduce costs of contributions are present because students pay only for the contributions.
* Incentives to use previous/shared course materials to limit the contributions to be repaid from student revenue. 
			
REMEMBER, once the contributions are compensated, the work becomes free, as in free lunch.

### FAQ
Q: How do you keep students from hiding their income and avoid paying for their education from their earnings?
A: I don't know. I think the idea that we'll have a future of anonymous payments is unlikely. I think we'll have a common identity system, and it will establish a standard for receiving funds and our society will have its fingers in there. When we work with some project and receive compensation, it will support a standard which allows for these revenue obligations to be respected. Just as we garnish wages today to collect child support, we will have an even more effecient system of garnishing wages in a smart contracting world. (Or, maybe not. Maybe we'll make anonymous, private payments a law, that it will be illegal to disclose a payment was sent or received. In which case, we'll have to trust the students to pay. Probably breaks the model, so rich kids can participate in education, poor kids, only through some social system or just not get education.)

Q: Is this a new kind of indentured servitude?
A: I don't think so. If the students choose not to work much, then the teacher doesn't get paid as much or as quickly. There should be no obligation that the students agree to any rate of re-payment, just that their future earnings will be garnished at a reasonable rate, with those compensated more paying more, until the contributions are paid. 

Q: What about liberal arts and classes which aren't directly focused at helping the student earn more money?
A: I don't know. Learning the liberal arts is a cultural value. If we increase the ways in which people can earn money through the liberal arts, then this model should work. If we don't value these things, then we likely won't pay for them.
